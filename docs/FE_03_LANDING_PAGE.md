# FE_03 — Landing Page

## Page Philosophy

The landing page must accomplish three things in 8 seconds:
1. Tell the user **exactly** what this does
2. Make them believe it's the **most accurate** tool available
3. Remove every barrier to **trying it immediately**

Design tone: Think Bloomberg Terminal meets Stripe's homepage. Dark, data-confident, professional — but with frictionless UX.

This is a **functional** mini-calculator component. It calls the API and returns a real (simplified) result. It demonstrates the product is real, not vaporware.

## Section 4: The Problem / Why It Exists

### Layout
Two-column. Left: problem framing. Right: visual.

### Left Content
**Section label:** `WHY IT MATTERS`

**Headline:** `Getting import costs wrong is expensive.`

**Body copy (3 paragraphs, short):**
- Traditional brokers: slow, expensive, manual
- Spreadsheet estimates: miss anti-dumping duties, quota rates, FX timing
- "Calculator" tools: ad valorem only, ignore customs valuation rules

**Stat blocks (3, inline):**
```
47%     of importers              12%     average landing cost         £18K    average customs
        underpay or overpay       underestimation in complex trades    penalty per breach
        duty in year 1            (our audit sample, 2024)
```
All numbers in monospace, emerald color.

### Right Visual
Animated comparison card:
```
❌ Spreadsheet estimate    ✅ veritariffai result
────────────────────        ────────────────────
Invoice value  £10,000     Customs value   £11,250
